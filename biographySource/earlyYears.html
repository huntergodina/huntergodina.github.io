    The Early Years

        On August 28th, 2000, a big-headed baby boy was born in Mobile, Alabama. After some deliberation over an assortment of other silly professions and names, his parents compromised on Hunter, appeasing his father's desire for a nontraditional
        name like Hunter, Fisher, or Sailor, and his mother's desire for a name that wouldn't get her son beat up in school. I was the first kiddo born to my parents, but they had been raising our two dogs, Hobbes and Aspen, a chocolate lab and a
        spaniel mix respectively, up until that point. Then, when I came along, things got turned a bit on their head. At the time, my dad was working for a sales company in Mobile, and everything was Kosher. I grew up, in the years that I cannot remember,
        pretty much the same as any little baby does. I did stupid, baby things, and got myself into trouble, and I was loved unconditionally by my parents. In 2002, my dad took a job with a new company, whose business required him to work in the Midwest,
        around Chicago and such. After a couple of months of him commuting to Chicago for days at a time, we decided it was finally time to pack up and move to the Midwest. My family bounced around a little bit, but settled into the home that I know as my
        childhood home in 2003. At the time, my mother also became pregnant with her second son, my little brother, Spencer. We moved into the house, Spencer was born, and the Godina family, equipped with there big-headed goofball of a son, me, had
        found their home for the coming years.
