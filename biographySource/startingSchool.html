        At some point, this goofy kid with the big head had to realize that he couldn't make a living off of Star Wars toys and cookies. Unfortunately,
        that time came much earlier than he had hoped - at the age of 4, when pre-kindergarten ended, and brought forth the beginnings of the life I would
        know for the next 15+ years. Kindergarten. Kindergarten, despite my experiences in preschool and pre-K, was a whole new world to a little Hunter. In fact,
        so were first, second, third, fourth, and fifth grade. Being the youngest in my grade was always an oddity, but never an issue. The biggest thing that set
        me apart from my classmates? Times tests. When I was in elementary school, I was a stud with times tests. You put down a sheet of basic arithmetic, and set
        the timer for 60 seconds, and it was like my birthday and Christmas on the same day. This was truly the first time that my academic abilities came into discussion.
        Teachers took note, and by the time I reached fourth grade I was working with our Advanced Topics program at my elementary school, where I would go on to meet some
        of the people that are still my closest friends to this day.

        I will never forget the goofy, poorly organized classes that I was dropped into towards the end of elementary school. But alas, like all other elementary school graduates
        can attest to, the diploma isn't worth much. The true test came in middle school, and testing into my school district's gifted magnet program - Infinity, or the I Pod. We
        were all kept in house at Wredling middle school, regardless of the district boundaries that would normally determine your middle school. We were kept up in a corner pod of
        classrooms, away from all of the other middle schoolers so we could... focus on our studies? Not many people can point to a part of middle school that impacted their future,
        other than maybe some funny blunders that they went through. But for me, middle school was monumentally deterimant of the rest of my life. The Infinity program brought me the
        total of all of my best friends, through the entirety of middle school, and even to this day. Now, looking back, I couldn't be where I am today without it. In fact, the format of
        the Infinity program is almost identical to the program I attend for college - the Raikes School.
